        <p id="Niconne">Dungeon Siege was commercially successful, selling over 1.7 million copies. According to the NPD Group,
            preorders of the game in the month before its release made it the eighth-best selling computer game of March
            2002, and upon release in the following month it rose to second-best selling, after The Sims: Vacation. It
            fell to seventh and then thirteenth place the following two months, and finished in 14th place for the year
            overall. By August 2006, it had sold 360,000 copies and earned $14.5 million in the United States alone.
            This led Edge to declare it the country's 44th-best selling computer game between January 2000 and August
            2006. By September 2002, Dungeon Siege had also received a "Gold" certification from the Verband der
            Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria
            and Switzerland</p>

                <p id="Niconne">The game was highly rated by critics upon release; it is listed by review aggregator Metacritic as
                    the third-highest rated computer role-playing game of 2002, behind <strong>Neverwinter
                    Nights</strong> and <strong>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</strong>, and the
                    twenty-first-highest computer game overall for the year. The graphics were highly praised; Dan Adams
                    of IGN called it "ridiculously pretty to watch", while reviewers for GameSpot and GamePro praised
                    the environments as being detailed and varied. Robert Coffey of Computer Gaming World and Greg
                    Vederman of PC Gamer similarly lauded the detailed environments, while Andy McNamara and Kristian
                    Brogger of Game Informer and GameSpy's Peter Suciu called out the seamless world without loading
                    screens as especially worthy of note. Suciu further praised how the freeform, seamless map was used
                    to create areas that were not shaped like rectangular regions with a winding path filling up the
                    space, as was typical with other role-playing games of the time. The IGN and GamePro reviewers
                    commended the sound effects as excellent and for helping to create the atmosphere of the game, while
                    the IGN and GameSpot reviewers also praised the "ambient orchestral score".</p>
