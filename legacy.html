            <p id="Niconne">After it was showcased at E3 2000, Dungeon Siege proceeded to win the Best RPG award from Game Revolution
                and Most Immersive Role-playing Game award from GameSpot. After release, it was nominated for
                the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences's 2003 Annual Interactive Achievement Awards in the Computer
                Role-Playing Game of the Year and Innovation in Computer Gaming categories, though it did not win
                either, losing to Neverwinter Nights and Battlefield 1942, respectively. The game was also a nominee
                for PC Gamer US's "2002 Best Roleplaying Game" award, but lost again to Neverwinter Nights. It did
                win the Best PC Game Graphics award from IGN.</p>

            <p id="Niconne">Gas Powered Games' release of the Siege Editor did spark the rise of a modding community around the game;
                even before release several modding groups announced intentions to use the engine to create large-scale
                mods remaking games from the Ultima series of role playing games. After the game's release, numerous
                mods were created, including several "total conversion" mods that made wholly new games and stories such
                as "The Lands of Hyperborea" and "Elemental". Gas Powered Games released one mod of
                their own in July 2002 titled "Yesterhaven", created by six designers over six weeks, which provided a
                short multiplayer storyline for low-level characters wherein they defended a town from three thematic
                plagues of monsters. It was followed up by Legends of Aranna, a full expansion pack developed by
                Mad Doc Software and released on November 11, 2003 for Windows and Mac OS X by Microsoft. The
                expansion pack added little new gameplay besides new terrains, creatures, and items, but featured an
                entirely separate story from the original game. In Legends, the player controls another unnamed
                farmer; after the Staff of Stars is stolen by a creature called the Shadowjumper, they set off to
                retrieve it. After fighting their way through monsters in icy hills, jungles, and islands, the player
                arrives at the mystical Great Clock, a giant artifact which controls Aranna's seasons. There they defeat
                the Shadowjumper and retrieve the Staff of Stars. It received generally less positive reviews than the
                original, with critics praising the amount of content but criticizing the lack of changes to the
                base gameplay.</p>
