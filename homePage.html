                                continent of Aranna containing deserts, swamps, forests, and mountains, created three
                                centuries earlier at the dissolution of the Empire of Stars. The main character, a
                                farmer with no given background who is named by the player, journeys through the Krug
                                forces to the town of Stonebridge. The player character is tasked
                                by the town's garrison leader Gyorn with journeying to the town of Glacern and alerting
                                the Ehb military forces of the incursion and defeating any
                                forces they encounter along the way.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Gas Powered Games was founded in May 1998 by Chris Taylor. As well as
                                helping create the initial concept,
                                Taylor served as one of the designers for the game, joined by Jacob McMahon as the
                                game's other lead designer and producer and Neal Hallford as the game's lead story and
                                dialogue writer. The development team included around thirty people during
                                development, with changes over time, and reached forty at the project's conclusion.
                                The development of the game took over four years, though it was initially planned to
                                take only two.</p>

                                copies. According to the NPD Group, preorders of the game in the month before its
                                release made it the eighth-best selling computer game of March 2002, and upon release in
                                the following month it rose to second-best selling. It
                                fell to seventh and then thirteenth place the following two months, and finished
                                in 14th place for the year overall. By August 2006, it had sold 360,000 copies and
                                earned $14.5 million in the United States alone.</p>
